## Algorithm

Do BFS starting from any node and we will reach a fartest node. Let's call it x. X is one of the end of the longest path. [Proof](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20010472/proof-of-correctness-algorithm-for-diameter-of-a-tree-in-graph-theory)

So we do BFS to find one end and do another BFS to find the other end and length.
